Figure 1: Proposed dynamic untangled multi-scale aggregation scheme. Darker cells indicate stronger message passing. Node colors reflect joint-level attention, and matrix intensities indicate reweighted spatial dependencies. As the action "Hand Waving" unfolds, attention shifts toward the moving hand, demonstrating the model ability to adaptively capture motion-relevant joints across time and scale.
